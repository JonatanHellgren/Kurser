1. Introduction
    Filters - Performs transformations on the image
    Segmentation - splits the data up into different categories 
        Esiest way to segment is to use the histogram and choose thresholds

2. Spatial random process
    {x(s) : s  ðŸ‘‰ S}, is a realization of a random process
        Observations are not independent samples, due to spatial dependancies
    Spatial random process can be characterised by mean and covariance
    Stationary and isotropy definitions
    Isotropic - circularly symmetric
    stationary - invariant under translation (same at every location)
    Process statonary and Isotropic get easier correlation function
    Semivariogram - used in geostatistics instead of cov
    Nugget effect - discontinuity at the origin
    Matern correlation - flexible correlation function,
        mix between exponential and gaussian
    Simulation of Gaussian spatial random process
    Differentiability for matern
    kriging - estimation of unobserved values
        need to estimate /beta (parameters), /Theta (cov) and /sigma_e^2 

3. OLS, GLS, ML estimations
    To estimate parameters for kriging model we can use one of these estimators
    Use residuals for godness-of-fit

4. Gaussian Markov random fields, LDA, QDA, image moments
    Kriging scales O(N^2)
    gmrf uses a sparse triangular matrix instead to scale better with increasing n
    Optimal discrimination
    Discriminant analysis
    Moment features
        central moments, hu moments

5. K-fold cross validation, m-nearest neighbors, SVM, neural networks
    Basically covering supervised methods for image segmentation
    
6. Image segmentation, Gaussian mixture models, k-means,
   morphological operations, feature extraction
    Covering unsupervised methods for image segmentation
    EM algorithm
    Relative colors helps GMM segmentation
    morphological operations on binary images
        - Erosion
        - Dilation
        - Opening
        - Closing

7. Markov random fields
    Begins with definition of mrf,
    then continues with ising model
    Autonormal MRF model
    monte carlo markov chain
    Baysian methods
    Gibbs sampling
    Metropolis-Hasting algorithm

8. Point process analysis
