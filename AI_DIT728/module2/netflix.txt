Netflix uses a method called Cinematch
Cinematch is basically using pearson correlation to detemine what movies to 
suggest
KorBell team of AT&T won with a 8.43% improvement in RMSE
They combined k-NN with SVD/factorization to acheive this
found that it was important to incorperate information beyond the rating
such as what movies a particular user rated
They developed new innovations for the task that improved axisting filtering
methods

Localized neighborhood methods are good a finding localized pairs, however
since the ratings are sparse this method is hard to implement
Latent factors are good at fining an overll structure, but bad at localizing 
closely related objects.
If we where to attemt extending the decomposition models to encompass the full
spectrum of relationships, a large f-value is needed, and we can't be sure that
it wont just capture noise instead. 
To include what movies a user rated regardless of what rating they gave helped 
the modeling process. It seem like what a user inteacts with is a very good 
predictor. 
Including more global effects helped the model aswell, like the averege rating 
of an item or average rating of an user. This made it more possible to model 
if a user enjoyed popular or more niched movies.
