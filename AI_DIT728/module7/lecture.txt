Dialogue sysyem and question answering

Dag is back!

Distiction between chatbots and digital assistanst
    chatbots - for general chats
    Digital assistans - for specific tasks
    Often rulebased

Properties of human conversation
    A dialogue is a sequence of turns
    In spoken dialogue it can be diffucult to know when a turn ends

Speech acts
    Constatives: committing the speaker to something's being the case
        (answering, claming, confirming, denying, disagreeing, stating)
    Directivenes: attempts by the soeaker to get the addressee to do something
        (advising, asking, forbidding, inviting, ordering, requesting)
    Commissives: committing the speaker to some future course of action
        (promising, planning, vowing, betting, opposing)
    Acknowledgements: express the speaker's attitude regarding the hearer with
    respect to some social action
        (apologizing, greeting, thanking, accepting an acknowledgment)
    Dialogue structure
        an answer usally follows a question
    Grounding
        making sure that the speakers are on the same page ('OKAY')
    sub-diagloge
        when a dialogue follows a tangent for a while
    clarification
        if a pearson didn't hear or understand something

Other aspects of conversation
    Initiative in conversation
        system initiative
        user-initiative
        mixed initiative

Infrence and implicature
    Things are usually said in context which humans picks up 

__Chat bots__
    used for free conversations

ELIZA
    bacsic therpist from 1966
    rulebased, keyword based
    Higher rank for specific keywords. Prefers response based on most specific
    keywords
    Memory based on the word my, sort of remebers it

PARRY 1971
    Acts as a paranoid person
    Includes model of metal state stat influences the conversation

ALCE 1995
    modern version of ELIZA with programming language AIML (AI Markup Lanfuage)

Corpus-based chatbots
    Based on very large datasets of realconversations
    Also possible with non-dialogue corpora
    Respons generation: not rules but single response based on user's last turn
    (or two)

IR-based chatbots
    1. Return response to most similar user turn
    2. Return most similar response
    Similarity e.g. based on word vector or word embedding
    Can also use information about user or sentiment

ML-based encoder decoder chatbot
    use autoencoder for dialogue

Microsoft TAY on Twitter
    TayTweeted Donald Trump tweets and got banned
    WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT 

__Task-based dialogue systems for digital assistants__
this will be the assignment

Dialogue system architecture
    -> speech recognition -> NLP -> Dialogue manager <--> Task manager
    <- text-to-speech synthesis -> Natural ^ language generation
    
    statistical/NN-based : Speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis
    text-based dialogue: NLP, Dialogue manager, Natural Language generation
    Task manager: A database with information that the bot can fetch info
    Natural Language Understanding: Extracting what a person says,
        Rule-based or increasingly ML-based
    commercial dialogue managers are mostly rule-based
    Natural Language Generation: mostly template-based,
        possibly learned from delexicalized data (data collected from humans in
        similar conversations)

Natural language understand (NLU)
    boil down the information in text to categories

Why dialogue management (DM)?
    Otherwise the user must give all information in one statement (no dialogue)
    can use a flow-chart
        system-initiative
        no flexibility
        works in simple cases

Dialogue Management - frame-based
    FRAME TRAVEL
    ORIGIN CITY ___
    DESTINATION CITY ___
    DEPARTURE TIME ___
    ARRIVAL TIME ___

Dialogue policy 
    In principle: determine nect action based on entire previous dialogue
    simpler: current state of frame and last turns
    Includer confirmin as well as rejecting possible misunderstandings
    can be based on ruler or be learned

Dialogue system design
    study the user and task
    simulations and prototypes (wizard of OZ-human pretends to be computer)
    Inerative design
