How AI became a part of medicine
Early AI in medicine: Expert systems
    store expert information for future browsning when questions occur
    These systems use logic for inference based on a knowlage base

Mycin(1970)
    early system to diagnose sever infections
    65% good suggestions
    dialoge system

INTERNIST-1(1980's)
    probabilistic system
    applied sybolic reasoning, close to neural nets
    Huge efforst went into coding relations between 500+ diseases and 4000 symptons
    can assign a probability for each disease

Neural nets in medicine (1990's)
    prediction for breast cancer
    only trained on a handful of features
    idea of neural nets started in the 50's

Drawbacks of earlier methods
    relied on manually curated knowlege bases, take a long time
    the probabilistic methods rely on know relations and thus scale poorly
    eatly nural nets suffered from a lack of data, generalized poorly
    this makes it hard to update and scale models

__What is diagnostics?__

Diagnostics
    refers to the task of finding out the cause of some phenomenon, disease
    causing a symptom
    Differential diagnosis, is to pick between possible causes
    By definition based on data 
    sometime manifested in flowchart documents, sometimes in medical intuition,
    sometimes in computers

Diagnostic criteria
    Diagnostic critera specify combinations of signs, symptoms and tests that
    are used todetermine diagnosis
    ofter international standards have dozen of criteria

Types of diagnostics
    clinincal diagnosis
    laboratory diagnosis
    radiology diagnosis

Testing 
    diagnostics are automated with tests
    can either be passivly collected 
    or actively collected
    diagnostic tests should admit some causes and rule out others

model-based tests
    a statistical test aims to esitma the probability that the assigned label is
    the right one
    This could be as simple as a shresholded measurement, but this generalizes
    poorly to multiple test/symptoms

A simple model naive bayes
    assume that sympoms are conditinally independent given the disease. This
    give us the naive bayes model
    the conditional probabilities can be estimated from data
    for discrete symptoms, it can be done using a table
    the naive bayes formula naturally handles missingness in measurements of
    symptoms/observation
    Easy to generalize into multiple disease

Kolleri: probabilstic graphical models

Why not just predict D from S?
    then we have not made any assumptions for the conditional probability 
    p(X_j|D) or prob for disease P(D)
    If X_1 in an X-ray image is it better to predict X_1 from D or the other way
    around?
    The answer depend on the application

A closer look at INTERNIST-1
    Was one of the fist syccessful commercial diagnostic support systems
    Based on Naive bayes model, but heuristic
        experst estimeasted p(S|D)
    applied to 500 diases and 4000 symptoms
    each diases was liked to each manifistation in terms of
    fequency, evoking strength and importance

Abductive logic in QMR (successor of INTERNIST-1)
    
Take-aways
    diagnostic test will almost never have 100% accuracy
    when they don't we must trade off specificity and sensitivity
    Early systems often suggested irrelevant diagnoses
    We must consider the costs of theses trade-offs

__Opportunities for machine lerning__
Why now?

Why machine learning now?
    we are collecting more electornic data now then ever
    9 times more then 2008 (US)
    electronic health records (EHR)

Large datasets
    MIMIC
        40,000 patiens in ICU
        domographics, vital signs, laboratoy tests
    MarketScan
        230 million patients
        based on insurance records
        (licensed)

Standardization
    medical records are becoming more standardized
    Example diagnosis and procedure codes(ICD-9, ICD-10)

Advances in machine learning
    Better algorithms for learning with high-dimensional data
        learning with L!-regulrization(LASSO)
        better algorthms for semi-/unsupervised learning
    Huge advances in image analysis(deep learning)
    Better, more accessible tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow,...

Opportunity 1. Improving consistency
    AI/ML improve consisency for example in pathology

Communication is important
    Only predicitons are often not enough
    It is necessary to justify outputs, e.g., usung visualization

2. Imporving speed
    Medical staff are incredibly time constrained
    AI may be used to speed up diagnosis either by
        making the diagnosis autonomously
        pointing our abnormalities and having physicians confim them
    THe latter is often more accurrete

Improving documentation and interfaces
    suggest likely symptoms given the knowlage we have about the patient

3. Exploration
    machine learning is not limited to known explanations
        this is in contrast to early expert systems which required hand-coding
    Instead, features are learned from daota

Pitfalls: Reproducibility
    Success in the lab does not imply success in the wild
    The CheXNet model for detectung oneumonia was found to generalize poorly
    beyond the study cohort
    correlation != causation

Take-aways 
    For an AI to have impact in diagnostic it need to beyond
    reproducible, implementable in clinical practise, efficient
    AI can not replace pathologists, but can spped up their work
    Data-driven methods have benefits but also potential pitfalls

__WHy is medicine special?__

Stakes are higher 
    A correct diagnosis can mean the diffenece between life and death
    We need:
        Robust algorithms
        Checks and balances to detect errors
        Fair and accountable algorithms
        Inerpretable outputs

Rationality
    Every action has a cost. This includes
        Taking measurements
        Treating patiens
    Example: Waiting for test of antibiotic resistance may delay treatment of
    infection. Perhaps more accurate but to late
    In medicine, we trade off time, quality of life, mortality, money

Different data
    Healthcare data rarely come with labels
        In some cases the best labels are i=unknown
        In other cases, otainig labels is expensive
    Sometimes the number of samples is small
        rare diseases have fixed, small number of patients
    Lots of missing data, varying time intervals, censored labels
