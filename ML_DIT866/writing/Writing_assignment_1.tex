\section{Introduction}
I have coosen to read and discuss the paper written by: DeVries et al.,
\textit{Deep Learning of Aftershock Patterns Following Large Earthquakes.} from
Nature 560, 632-634 (2018)

\section{Discussion}
The objective of the project written about in the paper is to model the spatial

mainshock rupture plane in to 5km $\times$ 5km $\times$ 5km cubes, which they
later performed a binary classification task where a one meant that there have
occured a aftershock in the given cube between 1 se
