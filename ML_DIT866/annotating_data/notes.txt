Types of supervision:
    Supervised, unsupervised and semisupervised
    Depends if the data is labeled or not beforehand

Two approaches:
    top-down: What do I want? What is the purpose?
    bottom-down: What can I get? From hwere? Using what kind of method?
Maybe you already have data from withing the organization.
Or some public data might be available, lots of data are available online

Possibible to scrape data from websites or using open APIs
    like transforming reviews rom amazon

Beware not all data is freely available, might be copyrighted
Possibible to instead distribute URLs, but they may dissapear

Assumption in machine learning:
    We assume that the test data is distributed similarly as the train data
    the sample is representative if what's true about the sample is also true
    about the population

Samling bias is a big issue, since the model will also in turn be biased

One way to reduce samling bias is to adjust the dataset with weights or removing
observations utnil the dataset becomes balanced. 

A good dataset is critical for ML
desiderata:
    large
    representative
What we end up with may be limited by what we can get
Discrepancies between training and deployment has an adverse effect on ML systems

## Annotating data
The main bootle neck for ML might b the need to annotation of the data

By annotating the data manually we try to learn specific domain knowlage from a
human in to a ML model. 

Tools for annotation:
    For smaller project excel or a text file migh be enough
    In the long run, it usually pays of to have specialized tools to tag the
    data

Vision and text might be the fields where annotation is the most necessary

So I'g going to search the internet for 100 opinions about COVID-19 vaccination
50 of which that are positive and 50 negative.
